# DB Go!

Disclaimer: DB Go! is a working name.  This project is very early
in the concept phase and is currently focused on YugabyteDB but should
be extended to support other types of databases.

## Background

The idea for DB Go is to provide a simple command line tool for
inspecting an existing database schema and generating randomized
data to load.
